# Test task for FNTASTIC

## First task

Convert the original string to a new string, where each character is replaced by the character
“ ( ” if the character occurs only once or by “ ) “, if the character occurs more than once.
When solving, the program should ignore capital letters
when determining duplicates (i.e. “A” and “a” are the same character). 


## Second task

The task should be solved on Unreal Engine 4.26.

Implementation should be in 3D. All aspects (models, sounds, textures), except code and blueprints, you can take from any open places.
OOP should be used, style guides should be kept, blueprints should be readable. 
!You cannot use any third-party plugins.

* There is a scene with three buttons called “1", “2” and “3".
* There are three “nests” on the stage: “nest-1", “nest-2" and “nest-3". It is implied that turtles may appear from the nests.
* Each “nest” has its own destination.
* When you press the “1” button, a “turtle-1” appears in the “nest-1”, which should start moving and go from its position forward to the destination point.
* When the “2” button is pressed, a “turtle-2” appears in the “nest-2”, which should also move and go from its position to the destination point, but according to the following rules: it goes forward for a second and stops for half a second, goes forward again and stops for half a second, etc.
* When you press the “3” button, a “turtle-3” appears in the “nest-3”, which, too, should start moving to the destination, but according to the following rules: it goes a second forward and then half a second back, again a second forward and half a second back, etc.
* Audio effects and visual effects are required when “turtles” appear, move and finish. The effects are chosen at your discretion.
* When starting a project, the level at which the test task is implemented should be opened.
* Models of “turtles” do not have to be turtles, you can use any other models that you can find.
